## Demo

See in in action [here](https://mschaeffner.github.io/neural-network-getting-started). Reload the page a couple of time to see how _wrong_ the neural network was to divide the points into 2 teams. Perfect would be if all are clearly separated by diagonal line.

## About

This is an easy example for a super-easy neural network written from scratch in Javascript without any framework or library. It's heavily inspired by a video published by [MPJ](https://twitter.com/mpjme) on his youtube channel  [Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q).
